# Final Project, WALK by Yuto Ohkawa

This my final project called WALK!
Data is going to be in the `data.txt` file! Play around with the schedules and change the availabilities of the users. 
* "Morning" = morning
* "Evening" = evening
* "Both" = morning and evening
* "None" = not available
* **Disclaimer**: This program is made to only handle specifically around 3-4 people since this is how many siblings I have.

Menu code is all going to be in the `main.cpp` file,
all you have to do is build and run now!

## Option 1: Print

Type 1 to print data from the users. It's all formatted nicely, and will print the name and the availability for each user.
## Option 2: Search

Type 2 to search data from a user. Enter a name of a user in the `data.txt` to print their data. If user is not found, the program will return a message. When you are done, type -1 to exit out of the search menu.
## Option 3: Sort

Type 3 to sort the data from the users. It will sort the availabilities in alphabetical order.
## Option 4: Match

Type 4 to match or create a schedule that will provide us information on who is available when and on what day. The program will try to be fair and assign walks equally.

## Option 5: Exit

Type 5 to exit out of the program
